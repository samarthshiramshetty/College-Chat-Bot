# College-Chat-Bot
A chatbot is a program that communicates with you. It is a layer on top of, or a gateway to, a service. Sometimes it is powered by machine learning (the chatbot gets smarter the more you interact with it). Or, more commonly, it is driven using intelligent rules (i.e. if the person says this, respond with that). PURPOSE OF THE SYSTEM The purpose of the chatbot is to drive e-commerce transactions, chat bots have also seen success in delivering daily news digests, weather forecasts and tracking personal habits like meditation, exercise or dietary goals. EXISTING SYSTEM: The chatbots are completely functional. Though the chatbot is providing the service ,it’s being difficult for the service providers to interpret the human responses and inorder to make it reliable everytime feedback is given in order to correct the chatbot response. PROPOSED SYSTEM: To combat this problem, developers are flirting with artificial intelligence (AI) industry and a solution is relatively close at hand. By feeding a machine learning algorithm thousands and thousands of essays, many people believe there’s a good chance of replacing human feedback on essays with AI systems.
